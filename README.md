Welcome to day 1 of the 5-Day Data Challenge! Today, we're going to be looking at how to deal with missing values. To get started, click the blue "Fork Notebook" button in the upper, right hand corner. This will create a private copy of this notebook that you can edit and play with. Once you're finished with the exercises, you can choose to make your notebook public to share with others. :



Here's what we're going to do 1's day:

* Take a first look at the data
* See how many missing data points we have
* Figure out why the data is missing
* Drop missing values
* Filling in missing values

Here's what we're going to do 2's day:

* Get our environment set up
* Scaling vs. Normalization: What's the difference?
* Practice scaling
* Practice normalization

Here's what we're going to do 3's day:

* Get our environment set up
* Check the data type of our date column
* Convert our date columns to datetime
* Select just the day of the month from our column
* Plot the day of the month to check the date parsing

Here's what we're going to do 4's day:

* Get our environment set up
* What are encodings?
* Reading in files with encoding problems
* Saving your files with UTF-8 encoding

Here's what we're going to do 5's day:

* Get our environment set up
* Do some preliminary text pre-processing
* Use fuzzy matching to correct inconsistent data entry
